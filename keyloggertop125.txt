The reason that I don't put a 10/10 tho, is that I found out that if you have a browser open, then the stealer of the keylogger won't work. Technically wise this is natural, but an option that will immediately close the browsers forcefully to implement the credential stealing, SHOULD be present in my opinion. Additionally, I would like to see other ways of persistence to choose from. I will like to put a disclaimer here, and say that I didn't have enough time to check all features before my time expired, so I cannot tell my opinion for all the features of the keylogger. Nevertheless, the features that I tried worked perfectly.\n\n\n\nUser Experience - 9/10\nUser experience is a complicated topic, but if we exclude some UI discrepancies (that I will go further into), I can say that it's pretty good. The software doesn't have an installer, and it's portable. Additionally it auto-updates as I saw, so everything is fine in that regard. Furthermore, I didn't found any disruptive bug on the application itself, and everything worked smoothly.\n\nSupport - 6/10\n\nI didn't encounter any technical issues while using the product, so I didn't actually use the support of OP. Now the reason that the support has that bad rating, is the fact that:\nAfter we had everything settled regarding the vouch copy with the OP, he took several days to actually deliver it.\n\nAfter my vouch copy expired, I offered to give him some technical advises regarding a topic that I am very familiar with (I won't mention what it is), and he still (2 days later) hasn't answer me.\n\n\nThis makes me thing that the OP is probably busy, and he does not have enough time, which could make the support very slow if the number of clients increase. Of course, this is one of the things that I experienced, and it could really be just a coincidence. Nevertheless, I am obliged to document it.\n\n\nUser Interface - 4/10\nYeah, the rating is not very good for the UI. As of now (11/13/2019) the UI is pretty bad. To give you an idea, this is the screen that I saw when I first opened the application: \n\nSpoiler (Click to View)\n\n\nThings got worse as I opened more and more of the windows of the application:\nSpoiler (Click to View)\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, I was horrified by the UI implementations, which is a shame since the product seems nice for the (initial) stage that it is right now. On the other hand UI is something that can be fixed, and I mostly post this \"UI Critique\" in order for the owner to actually see and improve it.\n\n\nOverall, I would put a nice 7.5/10 for this product. I believe it has things that can be improved, but it has the potential to become a very good HF product.\n\nGLWS OP  \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\nPlease feel free to PM me regarding any tech-related question you may have.

You can click on the link in the Log Viewer to launch the visited page in your browser immediately! \n\nApplication Activity Logging\n007 Spy Software can record all applications' window activity taken place on your computer! It will log the window title, the opening and closing time of the window, and the current user name. By this you can find out what movies/games were played, what files were modified, what pictures were displayed, and so on. \n\nScreen Shot Capturing\nNOT like other spy products, 007 Spy Software can take picture of the Windows Desktop just like a automatic surveillance camera! It will capture images at few SECONDS instead of minutes in other spy programs. You have the option of taking pictures of the entire screen or just of active window, and saving the pictures in high quality or low quality JPEG format. 007 Spy Software will also log the active window name and the time stamp when the screen shot was taken. When you click the record in log viewer, 007 Spy Software will launch the selected screen picture in your default image viewer. \n\nDisk Activity Logging \nThis powerful software spy on all file/folders change made by users within Windows Explorer, such as create file/folder, delete file/folder, rename and move file/folder, etc. These activities are logged by path and time stamp of first access. \n\nSecurity Features\n\nPassword Protection\n007 Spy Software is the most securely spy program since it is password protected to prevent others from starting or stopping the monitoring process, as well as changing 007 Spy Software configuration settings! \n\nStealth/Skilled Mode\n007 Spy can remove its Desktop Icon, Start Menu Group, and all its help files by just single click! Also it will never appear in Add/Remove Programs Menu or Task Manager.\n\nWindows Startup\n007 Spy Software can load automatically and secretly when Windows boots up.\n\nAutomatic Active Startup\nConfigure the powerful spy program to start in \"Active\" monitoring mode when it is started, then 007 Spy Software will record everything as soon as it run!\n\nAutomatically Hide Itself\nThe smart spy software can be configured to start in \"Stealth\" mode when it is started, so it will NOT appear in Windows Task Bar, System Tray, and Task Manager. \n\nAdvanced Features\n\nLog Delivery via Email\nThe powerful spy program is able to deliver logs to remote computer via its built-in SMTP engine at set intervals specified by users. All you need to do is just input your email address and press \"Test Now\" to make sure it works for you. 007 do NOT require your own SMTP server, so it's really much more convenient and simple to work than all other spy products on the Internet! \n\n\nLog Delivery via FTP\nThe screen spy pictures may exceed several GBs (Giga byte) in total size, so it's really impossible to deliver them to your email box, and it will also make 007 very easy to be detected by firewall or anti-virus programs. The good news is we have built-in FTP module which allows 007 to transfer all screenshot pictures to your server automatically! \n\nTime Scheduling\nThe smart spy program can be configured to start and stop at the set time specified by owner. This feature enables user to start monitoring at a reasonable time and avoid viewing too much useless log records. \n\nUser Filter \n007 Spy Software can be configured to monitor a set group of users on the computer, for example, you can specify the program to monitor only user \"Colin\" and \"Cathy\", but stop monitoring when the user \"Jason\" login. Or, you can monitor all users EXCEPT the account \"Administrator\", etc.\n\nFriendly Interface\n007 Spy Software is also the most easy to use spy program. It provides a much more easy-to-use graphical user interface than any other spy program, which will allow you to familiarize yourself with the software in no time \n\nIdle Detector\nThe smart spy program now can automatically halt screen shot when system is idle. With this detector, 007 Spy Software will minimize system resource usage and avoid capturing a large numbers of duplicate screenshots. \n\nHTML Report\nLike all other spy programs, 007 Spy Software allows you to export log records to a HTML file, so you can conveniently review them in a full-window browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer. Especially, the exported screenshot log file contains a thumbnail of each picture captured, so you can locate a screenshot picture as soon as possible. \n\nSort Log Records\n007 Spy Software allows you to sort the list of records in Log Viewer window. Most of other spy program do not allow you to do this. You can sort all records by User, Time, Action (Window) Name, and Content, etc. Records can be sorted by alphabetical order or reverse order. \n\nPowerful Search Engine\nThe powerful software spy also allows you to search keywords in log records. You can find out the item you are interested in as soon as you click the \"Search\" button! \n\nAutomatic Log Clearing\n007 Spy Software can automatically clear the most outdated logs when the log files exceed the size you specified. This will prevent 007 Spy Software from using too much of the disk space.\n\n\n\n\nCode:\n\n[dl=007 Keylogger]http://#.com/files/148091298/007install3.90.rar[/dl]","id":"post_223430"},{"author":"abel.meadows","content":"#2\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t09-30-2008, 10:35 PM \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIs this the full version or the trial version, and is it clean?","id":"post_223505"},{"author":"ryan","content":"#3\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t10-01-2008, 12:47 AM \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tim sure it's clean, but Avast picked up the rar as a virus/worm like it does with all tools/potential tools n keyloggers so unless u got a pretty good av im sure its clean.","id":"post_223705"},{"author":"VipVince","content":"#4\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t10-01-2008, 12:48 AM \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tKeyloggers will get picked up as ''malware/hack tools'' they are potentially dangerous in the wrong hands hence why your AV is going to detect them.","id":"post_223706"},{"author":"pfm102","content":"#5\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t10-01-2008, 12:21 PM \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhy am i getting this warning","id":"post_224123"},{"author":"pfm102","content":"#6\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t10-01-2008, 12:23 PM \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThreat Name - Trojan Horse PSW.Generic6.YwB\n\ntrying to infect my SVCHOST.EXE\n\n\n????????","id":"post_224126"},{"author":"taliv21","content":"#7\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t10-01-2008, 12:29 PM \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tthis is clean?","id":"post_224137"},{"author":"pfm102","content":"#8\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t10-01-2008, 12:35 PM \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tnot sure, i deleted it and cleaned my system after it, VIP can u explain why my AV detected it trying to attach onto that file???????","id":"post_224142"},{"author":"VipVince","content":"#9\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t10-01-2008, 01:14 PM \n(This post was last modified: 10-01-2008, 01:15 PM by VipVince.)\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tUgh...a little explanation...\n\nTry and download ardamax the most famous keylogger of them all of its own website..GUESS WHAT your AV will detect it as a trojan...\n\nNot because its a backdoor or anything like that,Keyloggers with email sending capabilitys get detected as trojans because it has to have certain trojan elements in order to send emails from a client to server...\n\nSo always remember because im sick of explaining this to people that think ''oh Clay Davis i got infected!i got infected!''

Yeah there's a ton of ways I can think of as far as spreading via pre-infected usb drives.\nJust a few off top of my head. No particular order.\n\n1. Selling drives. (Basic usage, pre-installed software/OS, etc.)\n2. Lending drives. (Friends/family/coffee shop/library/school/etc.)\n3. Leaving them around. (Should be obvious enough not to have to list places.)\n4. Returning pre-infected drives in place of new drives purchased/ordered.\n5. A good idea imo would be setup for auto spread via usb & infect the pc's nearest the printers/scanners/etc at schools, offices, library, etc. Since so many people who gotta use the printers end up using flash drives.\n6. School is given. Lend them to ppl/classmates who don't got theirs/one at all. Leave em around, ppl are curious in general.

Now you need to scrowl down and find the point Allow less secured apps. When your account is fresh or you didn´t do there something this should be Switched off. Now you just need to switch the button on and there you go you can use your keylogger with your G-Mail account \n\nI hope you liked my little tutorial, when yes then leave a post under this threat.\n\nHave a nice day,\nLeonfluf","id":"post_53161344"},{"author":"scorpi0n","content":"#2\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t11-20-2016, 11:23 PM \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYep, this is the way to go.

There were countless times updates (as well as new exploits) were added to it.\nThe crashes that used to happen were mostly due to using AntiDebug (which is enabled by default) on existing VMs/VPSes or by an irregular build config (usually happens when the builder is not ran as admin, it does need certain permissions to build).

You're better off getting a stand alone crypter and being creative with the assembly and icon.\nExactly. I assume its a similar situation with keyloggers that are popular off-site, at the point where you are working on getting it FUD (without making an in-built crypter, mind you, in the case crypter is automatically applied to the stub, and it is still detected, which is a possibility) - but all of those are done on the private renditions/versions of Sentinel (which are not sold right now, which is once again why we're highlighting it's just not a quick cash grab). Private versions are sold for $250 each, where the stub is completely private and the owner of that version dictates whether their stub will remain FUD or not. Some customers have used the same private edition for over a year by limiting the distribution of their respective stub. Removing detections is mostly the job of the external crypter you employ to use, not the base keylogger/RAT/botnet you're using.\n\nBy the way, in case you've been a previous customer of AutoLOG (lifetime), you were/are still eligible for a full Sentinel lifetime license. That's how we didn't force anyone to repurchase, unlike several other keyloggers on HF (Not going to call any of them out). It was re-released under popular demand (used to get 500+ emails/messages/add requests all wanting to purchase AutoLog) - so I eventually conceded all the files and my rights to my partner, Raymond Reddington. What he's made sure is that the keylogger is 100% functional, as well as hiring a support agent to make sure people are responded to (majority of them adding my skype due to cached pages of old sales threads, and the fact that I ran it during 2015-17.) Now, since sales are not only on HF, and a majority of them occur offsite, there is a lot of load for the support to handle (some people don't exactly contact the right handles), but there's been video tutorials for everything - activation, SMTP setups, exploit creation, etc. A lot of the off-site members are able to set it up themselves (similar to clients of Ardamax, although I can assure we have better support than them). \n\nThe changelogs mostly include updating password recovery for the new FireFox/Outlook/Thunderbird clients, which haven't been publicized due to the fact that they're revealed in posts (similar to Tesla) either by the support agent himself or me, if I get the post data from the agent.","id":"post_57352267"}]},{"title":"Basic Keylogger","posts":[{"author":"bexpr9","content":"#1\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t10-16-2019, 07:54 AM \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHi everyone.\n\nthis is my own keylogger that i maked just for enjoyment 4~5 years ago.\nit's simple and basic keylogger, but I post it for share and education.\nPlease feel free it.\n\ndownload : https://www.sendspace.com/file/7dlryb\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\nFeel free to ask me for help.

research project last year   \n\nkernel-based keylogger for Linux.\nA simplex kernel-based keylogger written for fun, not evil.\n\nFunctionality\nThe keylogger can do the following:\nHide itself from the loadable kernel modules list\n\nProtect against being unloaded by the user\n\nUnhide itself\n\n\n\nSupported Platforms\nThe keylogger was tested to work on Linux kernels 4.8.0-52 and 4.10 TLS as provided by Ubuntu in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.10 respectively, but it should be very easy to port to kernels in-between, as well as newer ones.\n\nSetting Up Environment\nInstall a compiler, Linux headers and all other things required for us to build the keylogger:\nCode apt-get update\napt-get install build-essential\nBuild\nCode make\nUse\nTo install the keylogger module:\nCode sudo insmod AKeylogger.ko\nTest whether the module is loaded:\nCode lsmod | grep \"AKeylogger\" dmesg\nTest whether the logging is happening:\nCode cat /proc/AKeylogThe log file will show the keystrokes logged after the module has been loaded.\n\nTo uninstall the keylogger module:\nCode sudo rmmod AKeylogger\nI can't link and can't attach the file\nSo I have to put in the code\n\nAKeylogger.c\nCode

So first I try the email and the pass on facebook(I mean the once we got from sql injection) \nand you realy won't believe how stupid people are to use the same passwords... Okay but facebook is not stupid\nand it will send an email that someone has triedto login into their acc. Which is what we need :D As soon as you\nget the message to verify your identity just  close the browser. \nFourth step:\n     Now we know that the user recieved an email of someone with ip\"blabalbla\" did .......\nso we open the setoolkit and send an email which will be very similar to the one we recieve when we get a code\nfor login or we login from a new device but it will say \" somebody tried to login into your account from ip\"blablaba\"\n download report (link here) and tadaaa you did it. I am saying that we should use setoolkit but it's not that important \nthe only thing is that you can send a html code copied from previous emails and just change it a little bit. Later we can \nsend phishing emails depending on what banks or maybe paypal, skrill etc they are using. And we will see that from the \nlogs we recieve. \n    Obviously you can always spam thousands of emails but when you did a long preparation your success will be more \nthan 50% there is no point sending your keylogger to a 100 000 emails if nobody opens the files. It is easier to lie \nwhen you first say the truth.\n\n    Thanks for reading I hope the info was interesting and you find it useful. And i hope other people share their own ways\nto send keyloggers or payloads. \n\n    Social engineers are the gods of internet!!!","id":"post_58788795"},{"author":"FMJS","content":"#2\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t07-23-2019, 12:19 AM \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tsocial engineering is the deal","id":"post_58789151"}]},{"title":"Help with FTP server","posts":[{"author":"Tourelle","content":"#1\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t06-26-2019, 06:14 AM \n(This post was last modified: 06-26-2019, 06:14 AM by Tourelle.)\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tI need to setup a FTP server (for free) and I need some help.
